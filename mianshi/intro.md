Hi, I’m Fei. I’m currently a Lead Platform Engineer here at TD, and I’ve been working mainly in cloud platforms, DevOps automation, and secure& reliable systems for about seven years.

In my current role, I focus a lot on building and improving platform reliability and security — things like CMOB/EZW active/active implementation, migrating pipelines from Jenkins to GitHub Actions, 
and putting more automation and security controls into CI/CD and infrastructure-as-code. 
I usually work pretty closely with dev, architecture, QE and DEVsecOps teams to make sure what we build is scalable, production-ready, and easy for teams to use.

The reason I’m interested in this internal move is that AOS team is  I’d like to get more involved in system-level design and distributed architecture decisions, not just the platform delivery side. 
This role feels like a great fit because it combines hands-on engineering with broader distributed system thinking, which is exactly the direction I want to grow in while continuing to contribute within TD.


🎤 示例口语回答

Sure — it’s an Azure-based Big Data platform supporting our analytics and model development workflows. Multiple teams use it to build and deploy models in a secure banking environment.

My role was mainly on the platform delivery and reliability side. I helped implement security controls into CI/CD, standardized deployment pipelines, and automated infrastructure provisioning using Terraform and Ansible.

One key focus was making the platform easier and safer for teams to use — improving deployment consistency and reducing manual steps. That helped shorten onboarding time and improved compliance visibility across environments.

“What’s your experience with distributed systems?”


That’s a good question. Most of my work hasn’t been designing large distributed applications from scratch, but I’ve been heavily involved in building and operating the platforms that support distributed workloads.

For example, in Azure I worked on infrastructure automation, deployment pipelines, and security integration for services running across multiple environments. That included handling scalability, deployment consistency, monitoring integration, and failure recovery practices — which are all important parts of distributed systems in production.

I’d say my strength is on the platform and operational side of distributed environments, and I’m actively growing deeper into system design aspects as I take on more architecture-related work.

⭐ 追问3：
“Why are you interested in this role / moving internally?”

I’ve really enjoyed working on platform engineering at TD, especially building secure automation and improving delivery reliability.

What I’m looking for next is to move closer to system-level design and broader distributed architecture decisions, where I can apply my platform experience at a larger engineering scope.
From what I understand, AOS team supports some of the bank's most critical transactions and account operations, like journals, settlesments and cheque processing. those systems really sit at the core of how the bank functions day 2 day.
This role feels like a natural step because it combines hands-on engineering with architecture thinking, and since I already understand TD’s environment, standards, and collaboration model, I believe I can contribute quickly while continuing to grow here.

✅ 二、如何弥补 分布式系统经验不足

而是找：

✅ reliable senior engineer
✅ can scale systems thinking
✅ collaborates well
✅ reduces risk
✅ improves platform

你其实很强在：

CI/CD architecture

security automation

cloud infra

migration leadership

cross-team enablement

这些在银行里 比写微服务更值钱

🧠 万能表达句（可以直接背）
⭐ 表达 transferable skills

While I haven’t focused exclusively on distributed system design, much of my work supports distributed production environments — especially around automation, deployment reliability, and cloud infrastructure scalability.

⭐ 表达 quick learner

When I move into new technical areas, I usually ramp up quickly by combining hands-on experimentation, reviewing existing architecture patterns in the organization, and learning directly from the teams operating those systems.

That approach helped me successfully lead pipeline migrations and platform rollouts even in areas that were initially new to me.

⭐ 一句终极加分句（很强）

I see distributed architecture not just as a coding problem but as a reliability, deployment, and operational problem — which is exactly where most of my experience sits today.

👉 面试官听到这个会觉得你理解深。

✅ 三、如果面试官更直接问
“You don’t seem to have deep distributed system experience — why should we hire you?”

可以用这段：

I’d say my background is strongest on the platform, automation, and reliability side of large-scale systems. That means I’m used to thinking about scalability, failure handling, deployment safety, and operational readiness — which are critical for distributed environments in production.

I’ve also consistently taken on new technical domains in my career, from security automation to cloud migration to AI platform delivery, and been able to ramp up quickly and deliver impact. I’m confident I’d do the same here while bringing immediate value in platform engineering and delivery excellence.
