Thanks again for taking the time to chat with me today about the AOS team and the role. I really enjoyed learning more about the work around transaction processing and account operations, and it reinforced my interest in contributing to such a critical area of the bank.

I appreciate your time and insights, and I hope we’ll have the chance to work together in the future.
