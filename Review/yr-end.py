好的，我帮你把 Looking Back 和 Looking Forward 两部分优化，使其更加精炼、专业，同时逻辑更清晰：

Looking Back

This year, I played a key role in leading GitHub migrations across Canadian Mobile, ensuring consistency and alignment across products. I strengthened my technical leadership by executing Post-Release Automation projects and collaborating effectively with multiple Lines of Business (LoBs). These experiences allowed me to take on greater responsibilities and independently deliver several high-impact initiatives.

I made significant progress toward our PI Objectives, a focus I will continue to prioritize in the coming fiscal year. Alongside achieving planning goals, I delivered reliable, results-driven services to partner teams. Additionally, I provided mentorship to junior colleagues by sharing best practices in software engineering, contributing to both their professional growth and the team’s overall capabilities.

Looking Forward

Building on this year’s successes, I will focus on leading the roadmap for Post-Release Automation. I aim to deepen my expertise and continue growing as a senior engineer, helping to elevate code standards and quality from Mobile to the Online team.

These efforts will further strengthen our platform’s performance and robustness while providing opportunities for me to grow both technically and as a leader.

要不要我帮你再压缩成一个更简洁、适合 年度总结/晋升文档 的版本（去掉一些叙述性语言，强调成果 + 目标）？
