Looking Back:

· This year, I am particularly proud of leading the GitHub Migration initiative, exploring post-release automation, and collaborating effectively with multiple Lines of Business (LoBs). These experiences allowed me to take on greater responsibilities and independently drive several key projects and programs.
· I made significant progress toward all our PI Objectives, which will remain a top priority in the coming quarter. I am committed to achieving PI planning goals while delivering high-impact, results-driven services to all partner teams.
· I provided mentorship to junior colleagues by sharing best practices in software engineering based on my experience, contributing to their growth and the team’s overall capabilities.

Looking Forward:

· I plan to build on last quarter’s successes, with a primary focus on leading the roadmap for TDU GitHub Migration.
· I aim to further deepen my expertise and continue developing as a senior engineer to help elevate code standards and quality from the Mobile to the Online team.
· These efforts will enhance our platform’s performance and robustness while creating opportunities for me to advance both technically and as a leader.
