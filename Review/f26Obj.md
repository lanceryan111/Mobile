Based on your notes and TD Bank’s F26 framework, here are three specific objectives aligned with your points 2-4:

## 1. Business Outcomes

**Objective: Enhance team efficiency and customer value delivery through process automation**

- Implement end-to-end CI/CD automation workflows to reduce build and deployment time by 30%, accelerating feature delivery to customers and improving time-to-market for business-critical updates
- Design and deploy self-service DevOps tooling platform that eliminates manual interventions, enabling development teams to respond more rapidly to business requirements and deliver value to our clients

## 2. Risk Culture (Own it, Raise it, Know it)

**Objective: Reduce operational risk through automation and establish proactive risk management culture**

- Implement automated vault risk detection and remediation mechanisms to remove human interaction points, minimizing security credential exposure risks and protecting client trust in TD
- Establish DevSecOps automated scanning and monitoring systems to proactively identify and raise potential security vulnerabilities and compliance issues, ensuring the security of client data and Bank assets

## 3. Leadership

**Objective: Drive DevSecOps cultural transformation and cultivate automation mindset across teams**

- Promote DevSecOps mindset at the architecture level, empowering team members to adopt “automation-first” thinking and building a sustainable culture of technical excellence and accountability
- Invest in team members’ technical growth through workflow optimization and knowledge sharing, developing next-generation platform engineers with strong automation and efficiency principles

These objectives are:

- Specific and measurable
- Directly tied to your actual work (automation, DevOps, security)
- Aligned with TD Bank’s three framework themes
- Reflect the key priorities from your notes: vault risk, DevSecOps culture, automation efficiency​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
