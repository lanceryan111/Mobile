Subject: Request for Short-Term Adjustment to In-Office Schedule

Hi [Manager’s Name],

I hope you’re doing well. I wanted to share some context regarding my current family situation and discuss a possible short-term adjustment to my in-office schedule.

My wife works in the public health system and is required to be in the office two to three days per week. We have two young children, and our younger child is under two years old and still on the waiting list for daycare placement. As a result, childcare coverage during the week is currently limited.

Given this situation, I wanted to ask whether it would be possible to temporarily adjust my in-office requirement to two days per week, instead of four, for a short period of time. Once our younger child is able to start daycare, I will be fully able to transition back to four days per week in the office as required.

I remain fully committed to my role and team responsibilities, and I will ensure that my availability, communication, and deliverables are not impacted during this period. I’m very open to discussing how best to make this work for the team and to revisiting the arrangement as soon as the situation changes.

Thank you very much for your understanding and consideration. I appreciate your support and am happy to discuss this further at your convenience.

Best regards,
[Your Name]

Hi Alex,

Thank you so much for reviewing my request and for your understanding regarding my situation. I really appreciate you taking the time to consider this and for sharing it with Buturab.

I completely understand the bank’s mandate regarding office attendance, and I’ll continue to work on finding solutions for the childcare situation. I’m hopeful that once daycare placement comes through, I’ll be able to return to the full Office-Focused Model as expected.

In the meantime, I’ll do my best to maintain my office presence as much as possible while managing the current circumstances. I’ll keep you updated on how things progress.

Thanks again for your support and guidance on this matter.

Best regards,
Fei

Would you like me to adjust anything in this draft?​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
如果你希望版本 更偏向“政策合规 + business-first”，或者 语气再更直接 / 更简短（给比较忙的manager），我可以再帮你出 1–2 个替代版本。
