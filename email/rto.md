Subject: Request for Short-Term Adjustment to In-Office Schedule

Hi [Manager’s Name],

I hope you’re doing well. I wanted to share some context regarding my current family situation and discuss a possible short-term adjustment to my in-office schedule.

My wife works in the public health system and is required to be in the office two to three days per week. We have two young children, and our younger child is under two years old and still on the waiting list for daycare placement. As a result, childcare coverage during the week is currently limited.

Given this situation, I wanted to ask whether it would be possible to temporarily adjust my in-office requirement to two days per week, instead of four, for a short period of time. Once our younger child is able to start daycare, I will be fully able to transition back to four days per week in the office as required.

I remain fully committed to my role and team responsibilities, and I will ensure that my availability, communication, and deliverables are not impacted during this period. I’m very open to discussing how best to make this work for the team and to revisiting the arrangement as soon as the situation changes.

Thank you very much for your understanding and consideration. I appreciate your support and am happy to discuss this further at your convenience.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
