I’ll help you draft an email to Robin asking about the auto-approve PR settings.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

I’ve drafted an email for you that covers the key points from your conversation with Robin:

- References the earlier discussion about auto-merge PRs
- Explains the 404 API error and permission concerns
- Asks about the greyed-out GitHub Actions settings
- Requests clarification on why it was turned off at the org level
- Asks for documentation/workflows and possibility of a PoC for mobile teams

Feel free to customize the tone or add any additional details before sending!​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
