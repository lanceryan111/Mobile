非常好，这是一个关键点 👍 你希望邮件语气上更像是“通知和协调角色（facilitator）”，而不是“owner 或执行方”。下面是修改后的版本，语气中立、强调信息传递与协调，不承担迁移责任：

Subject: Heads-up: Upcoming HA Nexus Migration – Action Required

Hi everyone,

We’d like to give you an early heads-up about the upcoming Nexus migration to a new High Availability (HA) Nexus environment being coordinated by the [Infrastructure/DevOps] team.

Our team is helping facilitate the communication and coordination across all impacted teams.

What this means for your team

Each team’s tech asset owner will need to:
	1.	Update the Nexus endpoint URL in your configurations, scripts, and tools once the new HA Nexus environment is available.
	2.	Update build scripts or pipeline configurations that reference the current Nexus URL.

We’re sharing this notice in advance so your teams can plan and prepare for these updates ahead of time.

Next Steps
	•	The Infrastructure team will provide the exact migration schedule, new Nexus endpoint, and a detailed migration guide in a separate communication.
	•	Once details are shared, please ensure your team reviews and applies the necessary updates.
	•	For migration-specific questions, please reach out to the Infrastructure team directly via [insert contact or Teams channel].

Thank you for your attention and for supporting a smooth transition to the new HA Nexus environment.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
on behalf of [Your Team Name]

这个版本的特点是：
	•	明确说明“我们是facilitator”，非owner；
	•	指出真正负责迁移的是Infrastructure team；
	•	语气礼貌且责任边界清晰；
	•	仍保留了收件方必须行动的指引。

是否希望我帮你加上 placeholder（例如旧 Nexus URL / 新 URL 的格式），让团队更容易理解要改的地方？
