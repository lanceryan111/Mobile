Subject: Heads-up: Upcoming HA Nexus Migration – Action Required

Hi everyone,

As part of our infrastructure improvement efforts, we will soon be migrating our existing Nexus instance to a new High Availability (HA) Nexus environment.

This migration aims to improve stability, scalability, and performance of artifact management across all teams.

What you need to do

Each team’s tech asset owner will need to:
	1.	Update the Nexus endpoint URL in your configurations, scripts, and tools to point to the new HA Nexus endpoint.
	2.	Update your build scripts (e.g., pipeline configurations, dependency URLs, artifact upload paths) accordingly.

We will share the exact migration timeline, new Nexus endpoint, and detailed migration guide shortly. This message is just an early heads-up so your teams can plan any required changes in advance.

If you have automated processes depending on the current Nexus URL, please start identifying where updates will be needed.

Next Steps
	•	Migration schedule and details: to be announced
	•	Support channel for migration-related questions: [insert contact or Teams channel]

Thank you for your cooperation in ensuring a smooth transition to the new HA Nexus environment.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
[Your Team or Department]

是否需要我帮你加上一个示例，比如旧 Nexus URL 和新 Nexus URL 的占位符？那样各 team 更容易理解要改什么位置。
