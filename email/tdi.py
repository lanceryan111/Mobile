Subject: Re: Heads-up: Upcoming HA Nexus Migration

Hi Adrian,

Thanks for the update. Based on my past experience supporting a similar Nexus migration, the overall effort on the TDI Mobile side should be manageable, and we will also need to align with ITS’s migration schedule since they are the service provider.

Below is the current understanding of expectations for the TDI Mobile team:

TDI Mobile Team Responsibilities
	1.	Dependencies and packages are already proxied from repo.td.com, so no migration work is required from the TDI Mobile team in this area.
	2.	Review and update Nexus URLs and build configurations for both Android and iOS TDI projects as needed.
	3.	Test and validate that build pipelines can successfully retrieve dependencies and publish artifacts to the new Nexus endpoint. (DevOps support can be provided if required.)

Potential Risks / Considerations
4. Build workflows may fail if Nexus URLs and build configurations are not updated properly. (May require assistance from DevOps team.)
5. Network instability may occur during or after migration. (Would need ITS engagement.)
6. RBAC configuration may not function as expected initially. (Requires ITS involvement.)

Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions, and we can assist as needed during the transition.

Thanks,
[Your Name]

如果你想，我也可以做一个更简短的版本，或加上时间线、明确分工表（RACI），让信息更 executive-friendly。
需要我也帮你准备吗？
